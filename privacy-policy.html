	<h2>Information collection and use</h2>
	<h3>1. Crash data</h3>
	In the event of an application crash or malfunction, and only if the "Automatically Report Crashes" option is enabled in the app settings, a crash report will be sent to <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry.io</a>. This report doesn't contain personally identifiable information and is only accessible to members of Flycast's development team. This information is only used to improve the quality of the app.<br>
For more information about Sentry's privacy policy, visit <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">https://sentry.io/privacy</a>.
	<h3>2. Online games</h3>
	When emulating software which uses internet connectivity, Flycast will collect and transmit data as instructed by the game
	or software you are attempting to run. For example, when playing Phantasy Star Online, Flycast will transmit game data to the Phantasy Star Online game server. Flycast doesn't control which data the game sends to the server, but it is exclusively limited to data inside the emulator itself.
	<h3>3. Third-party services</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Downloading game box covers and metadata uses <a href="https://thegamesdb.net">TheGameDB</a> service. Using this feature will share with TheGamesDB your network's IP address as well as the game identifier and title of all games in your library. Please refer to TheGamesDB's Privacy Policy for details on how this information is processed. You can opt-out of this sharing by not using the "Fetch Box Art" feature in Flycast's settings.
	<li>By default, if you use the Discord application on the same computer as Flycast, the game you are currently playing will be shared with Discord. This is used to provide automatic presence status update. Please refer to Discord's Privacy Policy for details on how this information is processed. You can opt-out of this sharing by disabling the "Discord Presence" feature in Flycast's settings.
	</ul>
